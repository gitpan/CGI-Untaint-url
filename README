NAME
    CGI::Untaint::url - validate a URL

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::Untaint;
      my $handler = CGI::Untaint->new($q->Vars);

      my $url = $handler->extract(-as_url => 'web_address');

DESCRIPTION
  is_valid
    This Input Handler verifies that it is dealing with a reasonable URL.
    This mostly means that it will find the first thing that looks like a
    URL in your input, where by "looks like", we mean anything that URI::URL
    thinks is sensible, (with some tweaks, courtesy of
    URI::Find::Schemeless::Stricter), so it will accept any of (for
    example):

      http://c2.com/cgi/wiki
      www.tmtm.com
      See: http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/1996-09-30/
      [http://www.angelfire.com/la/carlosmay/Tof.html]
      ftp://ftp.ftp.org/

    The resulting value will be a URI::URL object.

    URI::URL. URI::Find::Schemeless::Stricter.
